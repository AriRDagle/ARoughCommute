		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>The BANG of the shopping cart silences the whole plane for a moment, and then all of a sudden... </h2>
		<h5>HE SCREAM</h5>
				<p>Eyes rolling to the back of his head, Joe leaps into the aisle and curls up in the fetal position. His mouth is stretched wide open, letting an ear piercing, earth shattering, gutteral scream.</p>
				<p>I told you Joe doesn't handle stress very well.</P>
				<p>Seeing a grown man dressed in pressed kahki's and and a grey polo shirt rolling around on the floor foaming at the mouth, The other passengers try desperatly to get away. A mother throws her infant child three rows back to be caught by his father, a ninety year old woman reading a bible uses it to smack Joe across the face and leaps over the rows to the back like an olympic vaulter, someone's therapy dog licks it's balls in the emergency exit row.</p>
				<p>A traveling magician pulls a straight-jacket out of her carry-on, and with the help of the now thoroughly traumatized flight attendant, manages to secure Joe.</p>
				<p>Joe, now strapped to his seat by the straight-jacket, comes back to reality moments before the plane touches German land.</p>
		<h4>A man who is definitely not count Olaf speeds up to the tarmac in an ambulance, throwing Joe over his shoulder and tossing him uncerimoniously into the back.</h4>

		<h4>Joe will live in a German insane asylum for the rest of his life. He never found his passport, and was deemed unfit to make medical decisions because every time someone tried to offer him a cold soda or some pretzels, the screaming begins again</h4>
				<p>
		<h6>Nobody at Joe's new job noticed he was gone. Now Joe will never get to experience the seering indifference of a coworker he only kind of knows. And it's your fault.</p></h6>
