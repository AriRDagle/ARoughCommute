		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>Joe decides not to abandon the taxi, maybe he can get it back to its owner!</h2>
				<p>Joe slowly begins to pull into the median space in front of him so he can bypass some of the traffic. After all there’s only a few more exits until he can get off the highway, so he shouldn’t cause too much trouble right?</p>
				<p>The VW Bug behind Joe HONKS his horn aggressively, he’s clearly not happy that Joe went ahead of him. The Bug leaps forward into the very small gap behind Joe, and practically rear-ends him. So Joe wipes the sweat off his forhead and drives a little faster. Apparently that’s not enough for the Bug, because they continue to ride the taxi’s bumper at what couldn’t be more than a few inches.</p>
				<p>Joe is breathing hard now, he’s angry. He was in such a good mood this morning and then the traffic happened; and then the driver abandoned him, and now he’s being harassed by a little toy car. HE’S HAD ENOUGH. Joe starts to see a red halo form around his vision as his rage takes over. He sees a construction ramp ahead, and just SNAPS.</p>
				<p>Joe floors it towards the construction ramp and the taxi flies into the air! Joe presses his foot all the way onto the gas so when his wheels hit the tops of the cars he just keeps moving forward. Joe crushes car after car until he finally sees the exit ramp. He leaps off onto the exit and speeds off the highway, leaving a trail of destruction behind him.</p>
				<p>Joe sees the turn into his new job’s parking lot and breathes a sigh of relief. He was right on time. Or he would be anyways if it weren’t for the police barricade. 
				<p>Joe see’s the flashing lights and makes a move to turn around, but instead the car makes a horrible coughing sound and grinds to a halt. Joe is out of gas.</p>
				<p>All of Joe’s new coworkers crowd into the parking lot just in time to see Joe being led away in handcuffs.</p> 
		<h4>He was sentenced to ten years for reckless driving, destruction of public property, attempted murder, grand theft auto, and evasion of a parking fine.</h4>
