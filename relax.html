		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>Joe takes a deep breath, and says a prayer that he’ll make it on time.</h2>
				<p>He’s still worried, and he doesn’t know how the hell he’s going to get the taxi back to the owner. But he resolves to relax, and make the most of his time. How will Joe choose to relax?</p>
				<p>Joe’s favorite book is in his briefcase, and the taxi driver has left behind his breakfast.</p>
		<h4>Will he read a book? Or Eat breakfast?</h4>
