		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>Joe takes a deep breath, and tries to calm himself down.</h2>
				<p>One of Joe's favorite ways to relax is to people watch! He likes to look at a stranger and make up stories about their lives.</p>
				<p>There's a homeless man singing to himself in the corner, and a mother and child chattering to each other sitting across from him.</p>
		<h4>Will he calm himself by thinking about the homeless man? or the family?</h4>
