		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>Oh No! The taxi driver is gone! Joe leaps into the front seat.</h2>
				<p>What the hell is he going to do now? Joe doesn’t have anywhere to keep a stolen taxi, and he can’t get arrested because he has to get to work!</p>
				<p>“OH MY GOD I HAVE TO GET TO WORK” Joe shouts.</p>
				<p>Now in full panic mode, Joe tries desperately to think of a way to get out of this traffic jam and get to his job. 
                <p>A small amount of median space opens to Joe’s left, but he could also make it to work at a run if he abandoned the taxi.</p>
		<h4>Should he try to drive through the traffic? or make a run for it?</h4>
