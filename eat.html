		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>Joe decides to have some breakfast, after all, it IS the most important meal of the day!</h2>
				<p>Joe sees that the driver has left behind a fresh bag of Mcdonalds in the passenger's side of the car. He inhales two burgers, a large fry and two apple pies before he starts to feel a little parched. He looks around and finds a large soda in the cup holder and begins to happily sip away.</p>
				<p>All of a sudden Joe hears a rumbling from behind him. He’s suspicious, but the traffic is starting to move again so he focuses on the road and his drink. How strange? Traffic is moving, but erratically, as if they are trying to get away from something... </p>
				<p>The car in front of Joe violently veers off onto the side of the road so he slowly pulls forward into the spot. But the car behind him is frantic, and rear ends the taxi with a BANG. Joe’s head flies forward with a snap and the straw from his drink goes right into his eye!</p>
		<h5>OH NO! JOE IS BLINDED!</h5>
				<p>Joe stumbles out of the car to find someone to call for help, but with his good eye, sees a hospital on the other side of the barricade! He runs, clutching his eye, to the edge of the road only to hear a massive CRUNCH from behind him. Joe turns around to see a monster truck the size of a tank demolish the very taxi he was just sitting in.</p>
				<p>Joe screams and his good eye opens wide, just in time for the oil from the crushed cars to fly into his face and render him completely blind. Joe will never be able to work at an accounting firm if he can’t even see the numbers on the page.</p>
		<h4>A week later Joes wakes up in the hospital to find out his dreams have been crushed. A single tear falls from his artificialy re-constructed tear duct.</h4>
