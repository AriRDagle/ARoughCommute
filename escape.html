		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>Joe decides to take flight.</h2>
				<p>He screams, and runs towards the door, frantically trying to pry it open.</p>
				<p>The other riders scream for him to stop but he's determined. He grabs a golf club from a guy and dog in matching golfing outfits and prys the door open. Joe leaps out onto the tracks and takes off running. It's dark and Joe can hear his feet splashing in God knows what. Joe is running on pure adrenaline, but the adrenaline fades, and then he hears the noises.</P>
				<p>The noises of the subway rats.</p>
				<p>Joe starts to panic again and he runs away from the sound. But it's only getting louder, and now he’s lost in the tunnels. The noise of the rats is getting louder, and Joe swears their voices are almost human. He stops for a moment and takes a deep breath.</p>
				<p>“Everything will be okay Joe, you just have to get out of here”</p>
				<p>But everything will not be okay, because all off a sudden….</p>
		<h5>ONE THOUSAND RATS</h5>
				<p>The rats come from every direction, every inch of space. Joe screams as they swarm over him, and he hears the words "JOIN US" echo three times from the ocean of rodents.</p>
				<p>When Joe awakens he is in an abandoned station. He is sitting upon a throne of trash and his eyes are glazed over. Tens of thousands of rats scurry around in front of him. But he’s not afraid anymore. He knows what to do now. He snaps his fingers and all the rats stop and face him, standing at attention.</p>
		<h2>JOE IS THE RAT KING NOW.</h2>
		<h4>Joe is now the sole monarch of the subway rats. He doesn’t need work anymore.</h4>
