		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>Joe decides to fight for his life!</h2>
				<p>During his lunch breaks at the gravel company, "doomsday preppers" was always playing in the break room. Suddenly everything he learned from the show kicks in and Joe goes into full survivalist mode. </p>
				<p>First, shelter. Joe begins running up and down the train frantically stealing coats, blankets, and golf clubs. An angry chorus of "what the fuck!"s, and "hey asshole!"s, and "those clubs are for my dog!"s echo throughout the train.</P>
				<p>Then Joe starts stealing food. And this is when things go wrong. He snatches a whole foods bag from a woman in yoga pants and she SNAPS. She's screaming and stomping and brandishing her $300 manicure. Joe can see the pepper spray on her wrist, but he's a fighter! So he's not afraid! He looks her dead in the eye and takes a bite of a sandwich from the bag</p>
				<p>That's when Joe's throat starts to close. He looks down to see an innocent looking PB&J.</p>
				<p>OH GOD. JOE HAS A PEANUT ALLERGY.</p>
				<p>Joe reaches for his epi-pen, but in his rush to get to work he left it at home. The train is moving now, and some of the passengers are calling 911.</p>
	<br>
		<h4>Joe lives, but his esophagus does not. And he never talks again.</h4>
