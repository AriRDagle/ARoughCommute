		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>Joe decides to take fate into his own hands, and run the rest of the way to work.</h2>
				<p>Joe gathers himself, grabs his briefcase and a big chug of soda and makes a run for it. He puts the taxi in park, flings open the door, and starts sprinting forward through the traffic. His mind is a blur, and he’s clutching his briefcase to his chest as he leaps over car rooftops and pushes motorcycles aside. His heart starts to beat rapidly and his 120 lbs frame is dripping with sweat.</p>
				<p>Joe takes off his shirt and tries to tie it around his waist while he’s running. But while he’s distracted, his belt loop catches on a motorcycle and Joe falls HARD. He deliriously attempts to detangle himself from the bike, but instead ends up ripping his pants right at the seam. After freeing himself he gathers his clothing and keeps running.</p>
				<p>Joe sees his exit up ahead, at this point, all the other cars have stopped and are recording him or cheering him on. Joe reaches the exit and half the highway erupts into applause! Joe is feeling high on exhaustion and endorphins!</p>

				<p>He rounds the corner off the highway and sprints towards the parking lot so fast that his clothes fly out of his arms. But Joe is so excited to have made it that he doesn’t even notice. He runs up to the door, swipes his ID card from the lanyard around his neck and barrels his way into the office wearing nothing but boxers, a lanyard, and a briefcase. He looks around at the glorious beige cubicles, and the astonished coworkers who he thinks are just so happy he made it. And then Joe promptly passes out on the floor.</p>
				<p>When Joe wakes up he is in his cubicle. There is a folded set of donated clothes on his desk, a glass of water, and a note that says “please come speak to your floor manager Bob Bobson”. After realizing what he has done, Joe resigns himself to losing his job. He puts on the clothes, and walks past the withering stares of the other accountants. Joe walks into Bob Bobsons office.</p>
				<p>JOE: Sir I don’t even know how to say how sorry I am. I got stuck in traffic and I didn’t want to be late on my first day so I panicked. I understand if you no longer want to continue my employment.</p>
				<p>BOB: Well legally you aren’t an employee till tomorrow, so technically I can’t fire you. But I sure do hope you wear pants for your first day!</p>
				<p>JOE: First day…</p>
				<p>BOB: Today is Monday my friend! You weren’t scheduled for training until Tuesday afternoon!</p>
		<h4>It suddenly dawns on Joe that he could have stayed in bed. And he passes out again.</h4>
