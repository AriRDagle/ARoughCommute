		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>Joe sees an old homeless man in the corner, he starts to imagine what his life would be like!</h2>
				<p>Joe takes a long look at the man. He's wearing a dingy orange shirt and some khakis that are way too large. There is a pile of shoes ten pairs high surrounding the man. Curious, Joe imagines that the man is a retired shoe salesman. He was fired because he refused to sell his favorite shoes, so in revenge he stole them. He has been living on the train after he lost his home, but he always keeps his favorite shoes with him. Joe starts rifling through pockets to see if he can find some money to put in a shoe.</p>
				<p>However, while Joe was distracted by his day-dreams, he failed to notice that the homeless man had woken up and seen Joe staring at him. The homeless man was not happy, in fact he wasn't even homeless! His name was Kyle and he just really liked to nap on trains and collect abandoned shoes.</P>
				<p>Joe leaned forward to place a dollar in one of the shoes when he felt a SMACK on the back of his head. Kyle had taken the heaviest shoe and started to beat Joe with it. The whole train went silent and Joe could only grunt as the dirty sole of the shoe made contact with his nose.</p>
				<p>Joe passes out, and when he wakes...</p>
		<h5>HE ISN'T JOE ANYMORE.</h5>
				<p>The shoe knocked a clot loose in Joe's head and he was struck down with full retrograde amnesia.</p>
		<h4>Joe wanders off the train and into the crowd, Joe is the homeless guy now.</h4>
