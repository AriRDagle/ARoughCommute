		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>Joe decides to explore Germany!</h2>
				<p>All those dusty self help books on his shelf had an effect after all, Joe pats himself on the back for living in the moment!</p>
				<p>Joe has never even been outside of his hometown, let alone in another country. So he's not sure where to start, but a taxi stops in front of him and he jumps in.
				<p>Joe takes a taxi to the nearest town and gets out in the town square. What should Joe do for fun?</p>
		<h4>There's a pretzel stand on the corner, and a tour bus about to leave across the street.</h4>
