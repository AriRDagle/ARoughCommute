		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>Joe looks over to the cute little family. They look like they should be on a christmas card!</h2>
				<p>It's a little boy sitting on his mom's lap, they're wearing matching blue puffer coats and she's bouncing him on her knee while he laughs, adorable! Joe imagines shes a single mom, this is her first day off in weeks and she's taking her son to pick out a new toy. She's a line tech at a toothpaste factory but she's always had dreams of being a STAR.</p>
				<p>While Joe invents stories about strangers, the train starts moving again. Unfortunately the mother has now noticed Joe staring. Her name is Luce, and funny enough she IS a line tech at a toothpaste factory! But she isn't as nice as Joe imagined her. She stands with the four year old in her arms and walks to stand next to Joe. The train doors open and...</p>
				<p>She shoves the baby into Joe's arms!</p>
				<p>LUCE: "If you want to be a parent so much you can have him!" </p>
				<p>JOE: WHAT??</p>
		<h4>But it's too late, the woman disapears into the crowd and Joe is left holding the baby. Joe is a father now.</h4>
