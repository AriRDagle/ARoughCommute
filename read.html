		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>Joe reaches into his bag and  pulls out his favorite book, “Memoirs in Dress Pants: An Accountants Tale”. </h2>
				<p>Joe slows the taxi to a crawl and tucks in to his favorite chapter, “Divorce and Dividends: How an algorithm made me leave my wife”. Joe’s life is pretty bland, so he can get extremely absorbed in even the worst books. So much so, that he doesn’t even notice when his life is in danger…</p>
				<p>What Joe doesn’t know yet, is that a few exits back there is a stadium. It hosts the largest monster truck convention in the world! And the open bar, combined with the fact that monster truck drivers are by and large terrible people with anger issues, and very little sense of their own mortality. Makes for a dangerous combination. And since it's 7am, and the only people left at the convention are the hard core drunks with the big spiked trucks, there’s a rumbling on the horizon.</p>
				<p>In the rearview mirror of the taxi, the trucks emerge. The drunks have decided to drive home, and there’s no way a macho macho monster truck man would ever deign to wait in traffic! So they have decided to drive OVER the traffic, crushing every car in their way.</p>
				<p>Joe is still oblivious, his favorite character Bob is about to solve a very difficult tax equation. The trucks are getting closer…</p>
		<h5>BOOM!</h5>
				<p>One of the trucks hits the back of the taxi and gets its wheel stuck between Joe’s bumper and another cars hood. Joe finally snaps out of his story, and he is FURIOUS. Indignant at being torn away from Bob’s adventure, Joe flings open the taxi door and climbs onto the roof so that he’s standing eye-level with the drunk monster truck driver. Who is still revving his engine trying to get free.</p>
				<p>JOE: EXCUSE ME CAN’T YOU SEE I’M TRYING TO RELA-</p>
				<p>And just as Joe s about to launch into a fierce scolding of the drunken man, the truck breaks free and plows right through Joe’s body.</p>
		<h4>Joe will never know the end of Bob’s adventure now.</h4>
