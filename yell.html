		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>The slam of the drink cart against his seat ignited a red hot fury in Joe. </h2>
	<br>
				<p>Joe was a tried and true american, he had never left New Jersey, and he didn't plan to. He was a GOD DAMNED AMERICAN. After all, who needs to travel the world and experience other cultures when you have a perfectly good taco bell right around the corner!</p>
				<p>So when Joe realized that some idiot had let him walk all the way to the airport, spent $700 on a flight that he THOUGHT was going one town over. And didn't tell him it was REALLY going to Germany and taking him away from his beloved United States?</p>
		<h5>JOE GOT MAD</h5>
				<p>Joe was a slight man, he was only 5'2", and he had the thin sinewy arms of a baby bird. But when Joe yelled, JOE YELLED. The ragged roar of a 600 pound black bear erupted from Joe's throat as he stood up and lept onto the drink cart, scattering pretzels and fanta orange all over the family in the seat acrossed from him. He grabbed the neck-tie off of the flight atendant and brandished it at him with a angry flourish, his monstorous growling voice uttered only six words.</p>
		<h4>"LET. ME. TALK. TO. YOUR. MANAGER."</h4>
				<p>Joe locked eyes with the atendant, and was just about to leap forward and attack. When he felt the cool click of a pair of cuffs locking onto his wrists.</p>
				<p>"US MARSHALL SERVICE, STAND DOWN"</p>
				<p>Joe fought with all of his bird-like body against the arrest. But just as he felt like he was about to get the upper hand? Joe was knocked out cold by a nintey year old woman weilding a Fanta orange soaked bible.</p>
		<h4>Joe was sent back to his beloved America, and tried for attemted murder and destruction of property. His first morning in in his new jail cell he looked out of the narrow window, and saw across the water a short beige building with the words "Bob's Accounting Services: Now Hiring" in block letters on the roof.</h4>

		<h6>Congrats! You almost got Joe to work! Now all he needs is a spoon for digging, and he'll be able to show up for work. RIGHT AROUND THE YEAR 2050. </p></h6>
