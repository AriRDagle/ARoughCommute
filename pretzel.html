		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>Joe is in the pretzel shop, he inhales the scent of fresh bread and smiles. What a happy day!</h2>
				<p>Joe takes a moment to peruse the beautiful array of treats displayed in the glimmering bronze and glass case. He chooses the fluffiest, freshest, savory cheese pretzel, and takes a beer out of the fridge. There is a table open right by the window! Joe sits down in the dusky light, and sees a tour bus full of old people driving around the corner.</p>
				<p>How strange? The old people look angry, an old woman raises her cane up high and then smashes it down on something at the back of the bus. Joe swears he could almost hear a scream...</P>
				<p>But no matter! Joe has a meal to appreciate! He closes his eyes and takes a BIG CHOMPING BITE out of the pretzel. He looks content.</p>
				<p>Oh no. OH GOD. WHATS HAPPENING!?</p>
				<p>Joe is gagging and flailing his arms! He's choking on the pretzel! He tries to wash it down with the beer but to no avail.</p>
				<p>OH DEAR GOD IN HEAVEN! HELP HIM!</p>
		<br>
				<p>It's too late, no one can help him now.</p>
		<h5>BECAUSE JOE IS DEAD!</h5>
