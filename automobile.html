		<h1>Joe Doe's Adventure</h1>
		<h2>Joe hails a taxi!</h2>
				<P>It arrives right on time, and Joe is excited to get to his new job. Joe is happy, and ready to take on the day.</p>
				<p>The taxi driver turns onto the highway, and starts to twitch and curse under his breath. Joe’s smile drops, stretched out in front of them, a sea of gridlocked minivans blocks their path. It’s too late to turn around, and the taxi driver panics! He eventually turns around to look Joe dead in the eye. </p>
				<p>TAXI DRIVER: “Fuck this. Drive yourself. I’m going home.”</p>
				<p>The driver then silently steps out of the car, leaps over the barricade, and disappears into the city. Joe still has to get to work, so he hops in the front seat and takes the wheel.</p>
		<h4>Will he try to relax and hope the traffic clears? Or will he PANIC!</h4>
